# Vanilla-JavaScript-Timer
This project is a basic JavaScript Timer which uses various timer functions of JavaScript.
Here, a simple timer app is designed using JavaScript. The app uses various timer functions such as setInterval() and clearInterval(). setInterval() is a function which takes two arguments out of which the first is a function and it will continue calling that function until clearInterval() is called. The Id returned by the setInterval() is passed as an argument to the clearInterval() method.

Also, the project displays a live timer which keeps track of the live time. All the elements displayed on the DOM are displayed using DOM manipulation. For this, to select a particular query, querySelector() is used.

Live link for the project is given below.
